### Philosophy on Data Use:

--
### If we don't use data or existing research, we're guessing

--
### If we're guessing, we're biased toward the status quo

--
### If we resort to the status quo, we can't move forward

`r fa("baseball-ball", fill = "black")`  Changes in home run outputs were related to the changes in the game or the environment

--
`r fa("baseball-ball", fill = pal[1])` Dead Ball Era: Pitchers dominated with a larger strike zone reused 'dead' baseballs, and the ability to apply substances to the ball.

--
`r fa("baseball-ball", fill = pal[2])`  Live Ball Era: Clean baseballs and prevention of foreign substances moved the game away from pitchers and toward hitters.

--
`r fa("baseball-ball", fill = pal[3])`  WWII: Many of the best players went to fight in the war but the game kept going rather than being canceled. 

--
`r fa("baseball-ball", fill = pal[4])`  Expansion and Awful Ballparks: Strike zone was changed again making it easier for pitchers. But then, the mound was lowered making it easier for batters. 1973 introduced the designated hitter.

--
`r fa("baseball-ball", fill = pal[5])`  Free Agency: The financial market shifted making it possible for wealthy teams to have great pitching AND hitting. Also, ballparks got more home run friendly. 

--
`r fa("baseball-ball", fill = pal[6])`  Steroids: Fans loved seeing home runs and the players on the field became better at hitting home runs, due in part to performance enhancing drugs and hitter-friendly ballparks.

--
`r fa("baseball-ball", fill = pal[6])`  Post Steriods: Players were tested and banned for using performance enhancing drugs.
